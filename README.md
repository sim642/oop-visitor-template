# Visitor pattern

> The visitor design pattern is a way of separating an algorithm from an object structure on which it operates. A practical result of this separation is the ability to add new operations to existent object structures without modifying the structures.

Before talking about the visitor pattern in more detail, there must be a data structure to work with.

## Data structure
For the following examples, a tree-like data structure describing simple vector graphics will be used.
It has been defined in package `nodes` and has the following structure:
* `DrawNode` - base class for all nodes
    * `LeafNode` - base class for all visual elements
        * `RectangleNode` - class for rectangles
        * `CircleNode` - class for circles
        * `TextNode` - class for text
    * `GroupNode` - class for grouping multiple nodes to be treated as one
    * `ImageNode` - class for the entire image with a single node

They may be used to define an image like (in `DemoImages` class)
```java
new ImageNode(
        new GroupNode(List.of(
                new RectangleNode(10, 10, 100, 50),
                new GroupNode(List.of(
                        new CircleNode(150, 30, 20),
                        new TextNode(200, 50, "Some text")
                )),
                new TextNode(30, 100, "My cool image")
        ))
);
```

Structurally this is somewhat similar to JavaFX scenes and scene graphs. It is an example of **composite pattern**.

## Algorithms on the structure
The node classes themselves are very simple: they just store data in fields. With that in place, there are several different ways to operate on the data structure when different nodes should behave differently. For example print an image's structure or count its nodes.

### Overloaded methods
Firstly, these algorithms may be added as abstract methods in the base class and implemented in all the nodes. This is the simplest approach that we've used so far. It's not always suitable:

1. If there are too many different methods to add, then the node classes will be all about the pieces of all the different operations to implement and not the original structure itself.
2. If the classes cannot be modified (e.g. they're part of a library), then it's simply impossible to add methods to the nodes.

The next two approaches avoid these issues by implementing desired algorithms outside of the data structure.

### `instanceof` and casts
Secondly, operations may be implemented using if statements with `instanceof` conditions to differentiate different types. In the respective branches of such if statements, the object of the general type can be safely cast into a more specific type safely, after having checked it.

`InstanceofPrinter` has an example of printing the node structure and `InstanceofCounter` has an example of counting nodes via this approach.

It also has several downsides:

1. Using `instanceof` and casting is considered bad style in object-oriented programming because nicer and intended techniques are not being utilized. They are also rather verbose.
2. It is easy to forget to handle a type that may be in the data structure.

The next approach avoids these issues by introducing a significantly more sophisticated system.

### Visitor pattern
Thirdly, there is the visitor pattern. `FileVisitor`, used for `Files.walkFileTree`, also is one example of the visitor pattern that exists in JDK. We look at the pattern more classically on a data structure, not the file tree.

#### How it's created? 
It allows implementing operations by implementing a visitor interface (`DrawVisitor`) which contains a method overload for every concrete node type:
```java
public interface DrawVisitor {
    void visit(RectangleNode rectangle);
    void visit(CircleNode circle);
    void visit(TextNode text);
    void visit(GroupNode group);
    void visit(ImageNode image);
}
```

The abstract node base class (`DrawNode`) will have an additional abstract method for accepting a visitor:
```java
public abstract void accept(DrawVisitor visitor);
```
Every concrete subclass implements this in a very simple manner:
```java
@Override
public void accept(DrawVisitor visitor) {
    visitor.visit(this);
}
```
The implementation is exactly the same in every subclass intentionally because it cannot be implemented directly in the superclass!

An implementation of the visitor interface with corresponding actions for every node type can be passed to a node's `accept` method to run the algorithm over the data structure. `VisitorPrinter` has a corresponding example of printing the node structure and `VisitorCounter` has a corresponding example of counting nodes via this approach.

The latter extends the `SimpleDrawVisitor` class instead of implementing the `DrawVisitor` interface directly. It contains a reasonable default behavior (doing nothing for leaves, delegating to children for composites) to simplify creating new visitors.
Note that no `instanceof` nor casts are required when implementing an algorithm.

#### How it works?
The visitor pattern works through **double-dispatch**. When `accept` is called on a node with a visitor, two calls are dispatched:

1. The implementation of `accept` that runs is found using dynamic dispatch from the node's actual class, which overrides the `accept` method.
2. The implementation of `visit` that runs is found using overloading based on the node's actual class, which calls `visitor.visit(this)`. Because every class implements this on their own, the type of `this` is specifically that class and thus the desired overloaded version of `visit` can be run on the visitor. 
  This is why `accept` needs to be identically implemented in all the subclasses. If it were implemented in the superclass, the type of `this` would be the superclass type, which is insufficient to decide, which `visit` overload needs to be called. In fact, it wouldn't even compile.

#### Pros & cons
Visitor pattern allows implementing any number of algorithms on the same data structure without resorting to undesired `instanceof` and casting by adding exactly one method to the data classes. Thus it solves all the issues described above with previous approaches.

The pattern doesn't, however, come without its cons:

1. It is significantly more complicated than the other approaches, both in its creation and working mechanism.
2. it isn't always neater to implement a visitor, especially when multiple types need to be treated the same, e.g. in `VisitorCounter` class.

Still, the visitor pattern and other visitor-like patterns are widely preferred when dealing with hierarchical and tree structures consisting of elements of different types. 
In addition to specific application data structures, it's also used more generally, for example:
* Navigating directory and file trees.
* Parsing XML efficiently by streaming.
* Manipulating (abstract) syntax trees of programs in compiler construction.
